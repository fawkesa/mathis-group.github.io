I am an undergraduate student at Arizona State University studying computer science and biology. I'm fascinated by how these fields intersect to understand the origin of life and the 'why' behind complex systems and this world. As a Biocomputing Scholar, I am excited to contribute to the Microbiome Scaling for Astrobiology Project, exploring how modeling microbial ecosystems holds insights to life.
